        <p><img src="../img/londonbroil.webp"></p>

        <p>In the mood for steak but don't feel like shelling out the big bucks for a rib eye or New York strip? This London broil recipe is your answer.

            While most typically a flank steak, London broil can also be used to label other large, lean, and often tougher cuts of beef, including top round steaks and top sirloin steaks at grocery stores or butcher shops. More generally, it refers to how these steaks are prepared: first by marinating to tenderize, broiling or grilling to cook, and finally, thinly slicing against the grain to serve. Here's how to cook London Broil our way, to ensure a juicy, tender result every time.

            <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

           <p> <ul>
                <li>4 garlic cloves, thinlcy sliced</li>
                <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>2 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tbsp worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>black pepper and salt</li>
                <li>3/4 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1 1/2 london broil</li>
                <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                <li>fancy flaky salt</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>

            <p><ol>

                <li>Whisk together 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced, ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, 2 Tbsp. good-quality balsamic vinegar, 2 Tbsp. soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce in a medium bowl or baking dish; season with freshly ground black pepper. Whisk in ¾ tsp. baking soda (don't worry if marinade fizzes; that's the baking soda working). </li>
                <li>Prick one 1½ lb. London broil all over with a fork and add to marinade; turn to coat. Let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour or cover and chill up to 12 hours. </li>
                <li>Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium. Remove steak from marinade, letting excess drip back into bowl, and pat dry with paper towels; reserve marinade. Season steak generously with kosher salt and cook, turning once, until deeply browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 125° for medium-rare, 8-12 minutes. Using tongs, stand steak on its sides and cook until lightly browned, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, transfer reserved marinade to a small saucepan, add ⅓ cup water, and bring to a boil (mixture will foam up). Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly to avoid overflow, until foaming subsides, about 3 minutes. Add 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter and whisk vigorously to emulsify sauce. Keep warm until ready to serve. </li>
                <li>Thinly slice steak against the grain and arrange on a platter. Spoon sauce over; sprinkle with flaky sea salt. </li>
